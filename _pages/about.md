I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences at Augusta University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University, working with [Prof. H. Vincent Poor](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/h-vincent-poor) and [Prof. Sanjeev Kulkarni](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/sanjeev-r-kulkarni); I also collaborated with [Prof. Vahid Tarokh](https://people.duke.edu/~vt45/) (Duke) and [Prof. Taposh Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/view/taposhbanerjee/home) (University of Pittsburgh). I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania under [Prof. Hamed Hassani](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hassani/) and worked closely with [Prof. George J. Pappas](https://www.georgejpappas.org/), [Prof. Aritra Mitra](https://amitra2.wordpress.ncsu.edu/) (NC State), and [Prof. Aryan Mokhtari](https://sites.utexas.edu/mokhtari/) (UT Austin).

## Research

My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence with emphasis on scalable and reliable learning algorithms operating in nonstationary, distributed, and adversarial environments. A central objective is to develop methods that remain statistically efficient, computationally feasible, and robust under uncertainty, which motivates several interconnected research directions listed below.

* **Reinforcement Learning.** I analyze and design reinforcement learning algorithms under delayed, partial, or adversarial updates and derive non-asymptotic reliability guarantees for distributed systems.

* **Distributed Learning.** I develop communication- and computation-efficient methods for large-scale collaborative learning under heterogeneous delays, partial participation, and Byzantine failures.

* **Minimax Optimization.** I study convex and nonconvex minimax problems and construct algorithms with provable convergence guarantees in adversarial, asynchronous, and resource-constrained settings.

* **Change Detection under Uncertainty.** I develop sequential detection methods for high-dimensional and unnormalized distributions, including energy-based models, that adapt to nonstationarity with quantifiable false-alarm and detection-delay guarantees.

* **Submodular Optimization.** I design scalable algorithms for discrete decision-making under uncertainty with provable near-optimality based on submodular structure.

* **Meta-Learning.** I study adaptive learning procedures that transfer knowledge across related tasks, enabling sample-efficient generalization and reliable performance in nonstationary environments.

* **Decision-Making under Uncertainty.** I examine principled risk measures, distributionally robust optimization, and worst-case formulations to ensure dependable performance in safety-critical and shift-sensitive settings.

* **Robustness of Deep Learning.** I investigate the statistical and algorithmic foundations of deep models subject to perturbations, memorization, and distribution shift, aiming for guarantees on generalization, stability, and reliability in high-dimensional regimes.

* **Generative AI and Diffusion Models.** I study score-based diffusion processes, normalizing flows, and energy-based models with theory for sample efficiency, stability, and control of memorization, together with statistically grounded estimators based on score matching.

* **Multimodal Machine Learning.** I develop representation learning and modality fusion methods for heterogeneous data including vision, audio, text, and temporal signals, with guarantees for alignment, robustness, and sequential decision-making across modalities.
